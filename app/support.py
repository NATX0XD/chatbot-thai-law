"""Check that each citation supports the sentence it is attached to.

app/verify.py asks whether the answer names a law the corpus holds. That is a
question about *provenance*, and four rounds of acceptance testing showed it is
the wrong question to stop at. It rejected correct answers -- one refusal said
พ.ร.บ.สภาครูฯ 2546 "ไม่มีอยู่ในคลังข้อมูล" about an act with ninety-two records
in the corpus, because that act had not been retrieved for that particular
question -- while the answers that were actually wrong sailed through, since
every instrument they named was real.

What was wrong about them was the pairing. The tester's word-for-word examples:

    มาตรฐานวิชาชีพมี 5 ด้าน (พ.ร.บ.สภาครูฯ 2546 มาตรา 50)
        มาตรา 50 is the five duties of ethics; มาตรา 49 is the three standards
    ครูใช้หลักวิชาผิด ... (ข้อบังคับฯ จรรยาบรรณ 2556 ข้อ 10)
        ข้อ 10 does not contain the word หลักวิชา, or anything near it
    ... เรื่องสิ่งแวดล้อม (ข้อบังคับฯ จรรยาบรรณ 2556 ข้อ 9)
        ข้อ 9 is about treating pupils equally

In each one the claim and the cited text share no distinctive word at all. So
this module asks the other question -- is the claim supported by the text it
points at -- and answers it from the corpus rather than from the retrieved set,
because a citation can be checked whether or not it was handed over.

Three checks, cheapest first:

  1. the rule exists       ข้อ 99 of a regulation with 24 rules does not
  2. the sub-item exists   "(ก)(๕)" where (ก) has two items does not
  3. the claim overlaps    zero shared distinctive words means the sentence is
                           about something else

Distinctive is measured against the corpus: a word in more than a sixth of the
records carries no information here, because ครู, วิชาชีพ and จรรยาบรรณ are in
almost every rule.

The third check does not block, and after the sixth acceptance run it no longer
has to. What it finds goes into the repair turn in app/answer.py -- the writer is
told which rule and which mistake, and writes the answer again. A false positive
there costs one wasted call; a false positive that refused an answer cost the
user the answer. app/config.py can still make it block, and the flag rate on
correct answers is the thing to measure before doing that.

Two extensions the sixth round asked for, both here:

  * the claim is read on *both* sides of the citation. Reading only backwards is
    what kept this off: the writer puts the sentence after the citation as often
    as before it, and five of twelve correct answers were flagged for it.
  * a claim that cites a sub-item is compared against that sub-item, not the
    whole rule, which is the only way a wrong sub-item number is visible -- the
    words are all in the rule either way.

A fourth check was tried here and removed. It refused to let an answer convict
when BM25 after query expansion was below 10, on the theory that no rule used
the words the question used. Round seven measured it: three false positives on
questions the corpus answers well, and it did not fire on the case it was
written for. The reason is structural, not a threshold. This corpus writes at a
high level -- อบายมุข, สิ่งเสพติด, สิ่งแวดล้อม -- and teachers ask about เหล้า,
ขยะ, การพนัน. Nine in-domain cases have the conduct word absent from the corpus
and covered by a broader term. Word overlap measures vocabulary, not coverage,
and no threshold separates them.
